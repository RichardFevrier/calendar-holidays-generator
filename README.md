# 📅 Calendar Holidays Generator

Generate long-term holiday calendars in `.ics` format — currently only for France.

## 🧭 Overview

**Calendar Holidays Generator** is a simple tool that creates a standards-compliant iCalendar (`.ics`) file containing major **French holidays over a 150-year window**.

Most public calendars only span a few years, which can limit long-term planning or archival use. This tool fills that gap by generating a comprehensive holiday calendar.

Currently, only French holidays are supported — but adding other countries is easy, and contributions are very welcome!
